_Dear data scientists,_

this is Anne again. How are you? I hope that the projects are going well!

I am writing this email because Steven has this crazy idea. He has done a course on AI and really seems to think that we can use it. I am sceptical, because human intelligence is already different from the intelligence of an animal, is it not? How should a machine ever learn to think? 

Anyway, I am writing because one of Steven's ideas might not be that crazy after all (our competitors z-buy do it, and y-buy as well). Can we try to predict (like, into the future) who will buy something, on the basis of how they behave on the site? Or, if that is not possible, can we predict how someone will click and look after products on the site? Or, if you like this better, can you try to predict the purchases?

As a marketer, I would like to use that information to talk better to my customers. We could try to target and customize, that is really something we are trying to do more. I have no idea how well we can do that, and our computing power is limited. But maybe you find a solution. Steven would like to see what he calls a "meaningful evaluation" of that idea (3 ideas, pick one that you like the most, we are flexible!)

I am really just the messanger here, but we still have some time on your contracts, so I think that this would make for a nice last todo.

Good luck, and keep up the good work.

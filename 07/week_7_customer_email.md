_Dear data scientists,_

yesterday was a good day! We finally run our first experiment on our website. We have run the experiment to compare the effect of different recommender systems. We also have collected some data about purchases. We did have some problems with IDs in collecting the data, you will see it when you look at it. But overall the data was collected without problems. 

Can you find out which recommender we should use on the site?

Thank you!
